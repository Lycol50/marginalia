Marginalia v0.8.0 Release Notes
===============================

Marginalia is an ultra-lightweight literate programming tool for Clojure and ClojureScript inspired by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)*.

To get a quick look at what the output looks like, [visit the official Marginalia website](http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia/).

**Usage notes and examples are found on the [Marginalia Github page](https://github.com/clj-commons/marginalia).**

Changes from v0.7.1
-------------------

### lein-marginalia

As always, the prefered way to use Marginalia to generate your documentation is via the [lein-marginalia](https://github.com/fogus/lein-marginalia) Leiningen plugin, like so:

    :dev-dependencies [[lein-marginalia "0.8.0"]]

To run Marginalia, simply run `lein marg <options> <files>` in your project's directory.

### Multidoc Generation

Marginalia has long supported the generation of documentation where each namespace is contained in its own HTML file. This feature is finally exposed via the command-line/Lein interface and executed as `lein marg --multi <more options> <files>`.

### Bug fixes

* :url in project-info now creates a hyperlink for the project name
* Support for ClojureScript's data literals!
* Suppress comment parsing through [directives](https://github.com/clj-commons/marginalia/pull/126)
* Floating-toc HTML in generated uberdoc
* Sort files by namespace
* Improved handling of ClojureScript files
* Added support for .cljx file extension
* All of the documentation reflects the new library maintainer

Plans
-----

The following capabilities are under design, development, or consideration for future versions of Marginalia:

* Nicer looking `toc.html` generation in `--multi` mode output.
* protocol docstring support
* Explore the possibility of leveraging the [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) analyzer.
* Explore the possibility of leveraging [sjacket](https://github.com/cgrand/sjacket)
* More documentation and examples

More planning is needed around capabilities not listed nor thought of.
